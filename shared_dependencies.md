As we are dealing with Go language files, there are no DOM elements, message names, or data schemas involved. However, there are shared dependencies between the files "main.go", "go.mod", and "go.sum". These shared dependencies are:

1. Package Names: The package names used in "main.go" will be listed as dependencies in "go.mod" and their checksums will be stored in "go.sum".

2. Imported Libraries: Any libraries imported in "main.go" will also be listed in "go.mod" and "go.sum".

3. Go Version: The Go version specified in "go.mod" should match the version used to write the code in "main.go".

4. Module Path: The module path specified in "go.mod" will be used in "main.go" to import any local packages.

5. Function Names: Any function used in "main.go" that is part of a package listed in "go.mod" will have its version and checksum listed in "go.sum".

6. Variable Names: Any global variables used across multiple files will need to be consistently named.

7. Exported Variables: Any variables exported from one file to another will need to be consistently named across all files.
